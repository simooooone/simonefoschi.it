Based on Gatsby.
Below the instructions ->

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  Clone the repository and run it

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/simooooone/simonefoschi.it
    cd simonefoschi.it
    npm install
    npm run develop
    ```
    
2.  Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
